Soham, an otherwise level headed guy, is on a wild sheep chase to find out the truth. After being repeatedly told how what he’s doing is practically banging his head on a brick wall, but his inner belief system cannot let him drop the pursuit. Obsessive, introspective, factually ignorant, he wanders the streets of his life, only kept in check by his best friend.

And yet, being as stubborn as he is, can he really justify chasing something this awkward? Is he capable enough to control or contain the damage his actions might cause? Or would it have been better if he could let go without the trouble of going all the way….

_Find out in The **Obsession.**_
