## The Pilfered Diaries.

A blog website built on `Next.JS` with `Firebase` as a platform to showcase my literary works.

### Technologies Used

- `Next.JS (as the application framework)`: A React framework that gives you building blocks to create web applications.
- `Firebase (as the backend-database combo)`: Google Firebase is a Google-backed application development software that enables developers to develop iOS, Android and Web apps.
- `Bootstrap (as the UI framework)`: Bootstrap is the most popular CSS Framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.
- `Vercel (as the hosting platform)`: Vercel is a platform for frontend frameworks and static sites, built to integrate with your headless content, commerce, or database.

_And a few other libraries to take care of other minor but important tasks._

### Features Built

- Integrated [firebase analytics](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics) for page view tracking.
- Content served through [flexible MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) files, allowing for easy server side page generation.
- [Incrementally Statically Generated](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration) with regular revalidation on the background for high-speed cached page serving
