## The Pilfered Diaries.

A blog website built on `Next.JS` with `Firebase` as a platform to showcase my literary works.

### Technologies Used

- `Next.JS (as the application framework)`: A React framework that gives you building blocks to create web applications.
- `Firebase (as the backend-database combo)`: Google Firebase is a Google-backed application development software that enables developers to develop iOS, Android and Web apps.
- `Bootstrap (as the UI framework)`: Bootstrap is the most popular CSS Framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.
- `Vercel (as the hosting platform)`: Vercel is a platform for frontend frameworks and static sites, built to integrate with your headless content, commerce, or database.

**And a few other libraries to take care of other minor but important tasks.**
